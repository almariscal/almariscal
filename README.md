# 👋 Hi there! I'm Alberto Mariscal

I'm a **Data Scientist** at [Endesa](https://www.endesa.com/), where I spend most of my time doing **forecasting** and building models to predict the future (or at least give it a shot!). Recently, I’ve embarked on a journey to pursue a **PhD in Generative AI**, because I'm fascinated by how far AI can take us.

### 🚀 Areas of Interest

I'm passionate about:

- 🧠 **Data Science**: Turning raw data into meaningful insights.
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence**: Especially **Generative AI**, which is reshaping the world as we know it.
- 🛠️ **MLOps**: Automating and optimizing machine learning pipelines so everything runs like clockwork.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Here are some of the tools and technologies I frequently work with:

- 🐍 **Python** (my trusted sidekick)
- 🔗 **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex** for AI-driven applications.
- 🧪 **MLflow** for tracking and managing machine learning experiments.
- 🏗️ **Pydantic** & **FastAPI** for building robust and fast APIs.
- ⏳ **Time Series Forecasting** with **Darts** and other libraries.
- 🔥 **Pytorch** for deep learning tasks.

### 🚴‍♂️ Hobbies & Free Time

When I'm not working with data or diving into AI research, you can find me:

- 🚵‍♂️ **Cycling** with my bike.
- 🏃‍♂️ Enjoying a good day of **trail running**.

Being outdoors is my way to recharge and stay balanced. 💪
